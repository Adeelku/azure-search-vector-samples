      "page_content='Darkness is not void of illumination. It is the contrast, the area between light and \\ndark, that is often the most illustrative. Darkness reminds me of where I came from and where I am now—from a small town in the mountains, to the unique vantage point of the Nation’s capital. Darkness is where dreamers and learners of all ages peer into the universe and think of questions about themselves and their space in the cosmos. Light is where they work, where they gather, and take time together.\\nNASA’s spacefaring satellites have compiled an unprecedented record of our \\nEarth, and its luminescence in darkness, to captivate and spark curiosity. These missions see the contrast between dark and light through the lenses of scientific instruments. Our home planet is full of complex and dynamic cycles and processes. These soaring observers show us new ways to discern the nuances of light created by natural and human-made sources, such as auroras, wildfires, cities, phytoplankton, and volcanoes.' metadata={'source': './data/earth_at_night_508.pdf', 'page': 9}\n"
